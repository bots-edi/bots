It's hard to get started
------------------------

Often people experience a steep learning curve when starting with edi.
One reason is that of lot of knowledge is involved:

* edi standards (edifact, x12, tradacoms, EANCOM etc)
* business processes between you and your edi-partner (logistics!), changes in the business processes
* understand what your edi-partner wants/requires
* edi communication methods (x400, VAN's, AS2 etc)
* imports and exports of your ERP system
* specifics of the edi software.
* etc

It is hard to find good information about edi: standards are not always free (eg x12 is not free), decent example messages are hard to get and often if is hard to find good information on Internet.
Edi is traditionally 'closed' and sparse with information.
Partly this seems to be a 'cultural thing', partly because edi existed before Internet, partly because it is all about business data that is not for the general public.


Don't give up! ;-))
I think everybody who started with edi has gone through this.
